<p>I read a lot and have various interests that may includ but not limited to <a href="#economics">economics</a>, history, technology，design and, of course, business, and <a href="#leadership">leadership</a>.</p>

<p>I also love fictions.</p>

<p>I flagged a few books that I thought were particularly great in green and those that I thought were substantially above average in light blue. These designations are non-exhaustive, though, it's kinda hard to recommend books in the abstract. And I've no doubt missed some.</p>
