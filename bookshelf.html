<p>I sometimes post book recommendations on Twitter and people often respond asking if I have an overall list of books I think are worth reading. I don't, and end up feeling a bit guilty about being so haphazard. So, maybe this will be interesting to some people: below is a fairly complete catalog of the physical books I own. I always enjoy reading others' lists and browsing their bookshelves, so this intended to be a digital version of that. I've only read about half of the books here. (I guess I fall somewhere in the middle in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_ntDTaMUys8C&lpg=PT115&ots=E3jhWnG6aB&pg=PT124#v=onepage&q&f=false">Umberto Eco theory of the library</a>.)</p>

<p>I flagged a few books that I thought were particularly great in green and those that I thought were substantially above average in light blue. These designations are non-exhaustive, though&mdash;it's kinda hard to recommend books in the abstract. And I've no doubt missed some.</p>

<p>Since the stacks and shelves lack any particular order, so too does this list.</p>
